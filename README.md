# A-Maze-Shapes
A 3D game developed in Unity3D game engine, using vanilla Javascript, Adobe Photoshop CS4 and Google Sketchup. The player is a 3D shape that tries to get out of a maze which is full of traps: laser beans to switch off, pull levers to move or open doors, avoid sharp spikes appear from the ground and axes fall on the player. And all that within a limit of time!

This project contains ONLY ONE level of the whole game, and represents ONLY ONE example of the entire game.
